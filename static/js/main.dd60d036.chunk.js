I was then trained to become a project manager since I've learned the process of construction from estimating its cost. In the next 6 months there, I was a project manager assistant. My responsibilies include negotiating with material suppliers and subcontractors, communicating with clients, managing in-house workers, and preparing invoices. My final month there, I was put in charge of a couple projects with the offcial tittle as a project manager. During this time, I decided to look for a different opportunity that hopefully relates to my field of study. As the rule there, I notified their HR office 2 weeks before I left FG.
