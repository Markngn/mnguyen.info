&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My family migrated across the world to the US in 2006 right after I graduated high school from Vietnam.\r\n                        My family came to the US with very little to start a new life, so I had to help my parents to settle as soon as possible to keep my younger siblings going to school without delay.                      \r\n                        I couldn't start to go to college at the time, and I needed to start working right away to help support my family.\r\n                        I got a job at a Yatch refinishing company in South Florida for about four years. \r\n                        It was a fun and well paid job that helped me to support my family during that time.\r\n                        My family settle in a small fishing town in Luissiana, and we have a small fishing business.\r\n                        After my family settled, I went back to school.\r\n                        <br/>                \r\n                        <br/>  \r\n                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started to go to college since 2010.\r\n                        I didn't have a strong foundation of English to start college classes right away.\r\n                        My first year of going back to school was taking classes of English for academic purppses.            \r\n                        There wasn't a clear plan on what feild of study that I should pick at the begging.\r\n                        I decided to learn about computer technologies because I didn't have any knowledge about computer.\r\n                        Since I enjoy learning new things, I didn't rush through school to get a degree.\r\n                        I took my time with studying to prevent burnt out, so I took time off to work in our family fishing boats at least one semester every year.\r\n                        By doing that, I made enough money to pay for my school expenses without taking loans.\r\n                        It takes longer to finish school, but I am free from debt when I am finished.\r\n                        <br/>                \r\n                        <br/>  \r\n                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I took an

a lot of effort into training me, and I appreciate that.\r\n                        However, I would like to look for other positions that I would fit in better.\r\n                    </p>\r\n

           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is always more to learn. \r\n                        Learning is a process of continuously enhance knowledge. \r\n                        As long as I thrive to improve myself, I can learn more.\r\n                        This is the reason that I started pursuing a college degree after a long time since I graduated high school.\r\n                        It was hard to start because I didn't know how and where to start.                                                                    \r\n                        After I did some research on where is my best option, I decided to start from a state community college that I can afford.\r\n                        I started at St. Petersburg College (SPC) in Tampa Florida, and I earned my Associate degree in Arts (AA) with Magna Cum Laude there.\r\n                    <br/>                \r\n                    <br/>\r\n                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I transfered to University of Central Florida (UCF, Orlando) to pursue my Bachelor degree after I earned an AA degree at SPC. \r\n                        At UCF, I decided to work on double majors: Computer Science (CS) and Computer Engineering (CPE).\r\n                        I focused on common courses at the beginning, and then I worked forward CS courses after that.\r\n                        UCF uses an exam called Foundation Exam (FE) to force students who do not pass it with 3 attempts to change their major from CS. \r\n                        FE is the entrance qualification for my 5 final courses of CS major.                         \r\n                        I didn't make it to earn a CS degree at UCF, so I had to drop it from my study plan there.\r\n                        However, since I majored in CPE which required many math courses, I added a math minor back to my study plan.\r\n                        In August 2020, I graduated from UCF with a Bachelor degree in Computer Engineering with a Minor degree in Mathematics.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                </div>         \r\n            </div>\r\n        </>\r\n    ) \r\n}\r\n\r\n \r\n","import React from

people who have different background and knowledge.\r\n                        It helps me to develope a good interpersonel skill to quickly adapt to new groups.\r\n                        Since I studied computer engineering and computer science, I've worked in multiple software projects. \r\n                        The majority of those were team projects. \r\n                        I like

with both front-end and back-end development. \r\n                        In school we were taught some basic programing languages such as Java, C, SQL, and HTML.\r\n                        These tools are useful but mostly outdated. \r\n                        In my free time, I've learned other programing languages, and one of them is JavaScript.\r\n                        It is a very

after I graduated.\r\n                        It was the first opportunity that I got since I graduated during a pandamic. I worked there for 9 months.\r\n                        I started as a project engineer.\r\n                        My responsibility mostly review construction plans to help estimators to bid for up coming jobs.\r\n                        Since I have computer related background, I was selected to train to become an estimator with a new estimating software that they recently purchased.\r\n                        After 2 months since I started, I became a jr. estimator. \r\n                        We won some big jobs that would keep our workers busy for a while, so we slowed down in bidding for more jobs.\r\n                        I was then trained to become a project manager since I've learned the process of construction from estimating its cost.\r\n                        In the next 6 months there, I was a project manager assistant. My responsibilies include negotiating with material suppliers and subcontractors, communicating with clients, managing in-house workers, and preparing invoices. \r\n                        My final month there, I was put in charge of a couple projects with the offcial tittle as a project manager. \r\n                        During this time, I decided to look for a different opportunity that hopefully relates to my field of study.\r\n                        As the rule there, I notified their HR office 2 weeks before I left FG. \r\n                        In the last two weeks, I was able to transfer my in-progress projects to other project managers smoothly without any problem. \r\n                        Overall, it was a great experience with them.\r\n                    </p>\r\n            </div>    \r\n        </div>\r\n    </>\r\n    );\r\n    \r\n}\r\n\r\n \r\n","import React from 'react';\nimport './App.css';\nimport Navbar from './components/Navbar';\nimport {BrowserRouter as Router, Switch, Route} from 'react-router-dom';\nimport Home from './components/pages/Home';\nimport About from './components/pages/About';\nimport Contact from './components/pages/Contact';\nimport Education from './components/pages/Education';\nimport Experience from './components/pages/Experience';\n\n\n// const TestComponent = () => { return <h3>Test component</h3> }\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Router>\n        <Navbar />\n        <Switch>\n          <Route path='/' exact component={Home} />\n          <Route path='/About' component={About} />\n          <Route path='/Contact' component={Contact} />\n          <Route path='/Education' component={Education} />\n          <Route path='/Experience' component={Experience} />\n          \n        </Switch>\n      </Router>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport App from './App';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <App />,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
